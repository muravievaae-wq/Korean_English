  syllableBuilding: "Building Syllable Blocks in Korean",
  syllableIntro: "Korean words are made up of syllable blocks. Each block represents one syllable and always contains at least one consonant and one vowel. The consonant 'ㅇ' is used as a silent placeholder if a syllable starts with a vowel sound.",
  syllableCase1Title: "1. Syllable without a Final Consonant (No Batchim)",
  syllableCase1Desc: "The structure of the syllable depends on the shape of the vowel.",
  verticalVowel: "Vertical Vowel (ㅏ, ㅑ, ㅓ, ㅕ, ㅣ)",
  verticalVowelDesc: "The consonant is written to the left of the vowel.",
  horizontalVowel: "Horizontal Vowel (ㅗ, ㅛ, ㅜ, ㅠ, ㅡ)",
  horizontalVowelDesc: "The consonant is written above the vowel.",
  syllableCase2Title: "2. Syllable with a Final Consonant (With Batchim)",
  syllableCase2Desc: "If a syllable has a third (or fourth) consonant, it is written at the bottom of the block. This position is called 'Batchim' (받침).",
  verticalVowelBatchim: "With a Vertical Vowel",
  horizontalVowelBatchim: "With a Horizontal Vowel",

  // Batchim Rules
  batchimTitle: "Batchim (받침) - Final Consonant Pronunciation Rules",
  batchimIntro: "Although any consonant (except ㄸ, ㅃ, ㅉ) can be a Batchim, they are only pronounced as one of 7 representative sounds. This is one of the most crucial reading rules.",
  batchimTableSound: "Sound",

  // Advanced Rules
  advancedRulesTitle: "Advanced Pronunciation Rules",
  linkingRuleTitle: "Linking (Sound Carry-over)",
  linkingRuleDesc: "If a syllable ends with a consonant (Batchim) and the next syllable begins with a vowel (i.e., with 'ㅇ'), the sound of the final consonant 'moves over' to the place of the 'ㅇ' in the next syllable. This makes speech flow smoothly.",
  linkingRuleExample1: "밥 + 은 → [바븐] (ba-beun), not [bap-eun]",
  linkingRuleExample2: "한국어 → [한구거] (han-gu-geo), not [han-guk-eo]",
  nasalAssimilationTitle: "Nasal Assimilation (동화)",
  nasalAssimilationDesc: "Some Batchim consonants change their pronunciation when followed by a nasal consonant (ㄴ or ㅁ) to make them easier to pronounce together.",
  nasalAssimilationRule1: "ㄱ, ㄲ, ㅋ (in Batchim) + ㄴ/ㅁ → pronounced as [ㅇ] (ng)",
  nasalAssimilationExample1: "국물 → [궁물] (gung-mul)",
  nasalAssimilationRule2: "ㄷ, ㅌ, ㅅ, ㅆ, ㅈ, ㅊ (in Batchim) + ㄴ/ㅁ → pronounced as [ㄴ]",
  nasalAssimilationExample2: "있는 → [인는] (in-neun)",
  nasalAssimilationRule3: "ㅂ, ㅍ (in Batchim) + ㄴ/ㅁ → pronounced as [ㅁ]",
  nasalAssimilationExample3: "입니다 → [임니다] (im-ni-da)",
